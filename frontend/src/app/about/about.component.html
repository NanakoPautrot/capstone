 <h5> Two friends came together to develop this website to help parents in finding child friendly restaurants in Hong Kong. As parents themselves, they undestand that most parents need a good list of places that they could go to to enjoy meal times with the family and Nook was created with the very goal of providing just that.  </h5>
